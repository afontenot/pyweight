# Welcome to PyWeight!

PyWeight is a simple weight management program for your desktop. 
PyWeight makes it easy to track your weight over time and can
suggest changes to the number of calories you are eating to help you
hit targets for weight loss, gains, or even maintenance.

## Using PyWeight

PyWeight uses statistics to more accurate determine changes in your
weight over time. This approach works best when you weigh yourself
every day. The program can provide advice on how to modify your
calorie intake to meet goals that you set yourself.
