# How to Manage Your Weight with PyWeight

PyWeight makes weight management simple!

The approach we take to weight management requires you to weigh
yourself every day.

PyWeight uses these values to calculate a more accurate estimate of
your weight changes over time. Don't worry if the measurements seem
to fluctuate a lot. Day to day changes in your weight are more likely
to be the result of water weight than anything to be concerned about.

### Scales

PyWeight works best if you have an accurate scale, preferably a
digital one, with measurement precision to at least 0.2 pounds
(0.1 kg).

Any such scale will do, you don't need any advanced features --- and
you shouldn't trust some features, like body fat measurements.

### Planning a diet

When you plan a diet with PyWeight, you'll enter your desired *rate*
of weight change (for example, losing 1 pound a week) into the
program. PyWeight will help you hit that target by determining
whether you missed your goal, and estimating by how many calories,
every several weeks.

If you are creating precise meal plans, you can use this information
to make an exact adjustment to your intake. Because PyWeight's advice
is based on models derived from many people who aren't fully like
you, you might find that PyWeight consistently overestimates or
underestimates the change you need to make. In that case, you can
make a reasonable adjustment based on the value PyWeight provides.

A major advantage of Pyweight, though, is that it is easy to make 
diet adjustments *without* calorie counting or precise meal plans.
If PyWeight tells you to eat 100 more calories a day, you can guess
about how much of a change that is. It's not a big deal if you get 
it wrong; after another period of several weeks, you'll be prompted 
again to make changes. As long as you continue to move in the right 
direction each time, you can expect to see success.
