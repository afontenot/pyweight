<h1 id="guide-to-using-pyweight">Guide to Using PyWeight</h1>
<p>Using PyWeight is easy! Read this document to learn more about basic
PyWeight operations.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The first time you start PyWeight, you should be greeted by the
built-in Guide. This window provides you with basic information about
PyWeight, and will have you perform the necessary setup
automatically.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/guide.png"
alt="Fig 1. Screenshot of guide window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 1. Screenshot of guide
window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>PyWeight needs to create two files to store your data. One of these
is a <strong>plan file</strong>, and contains personal information about
you, including your height, age, and gender. PyWeight uses this
information in order to provide more accurate advice to you about how to
adjust your calorie intake. PyWeight is an entirely offline and open
source application, so you can be assured that this data is not sent to
anyone, even the developers of PyWeight.</p>
<p>If you click “No” at the guide prompt, or ever need to create a new
<strong>plan</strong>, you can do so from the program’s File menu.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/new_plan.png"
alt="Fig 2. New Plan option in file menu" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 2. New Plan option in file
menu</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you create a new <strong>plan</strong>, you will be prompted to
save a file, with the extension <code>.wmplan</code>. With PyWeight’s
default settings, you won’t need to remember where you saved this file
because it will be opened for you automatically in the future. However,
you may want to keep it somewhere you’ll remember so you can create
backups.</p>
<p>After saving your plan file you will be prompted to change your plan
settings. You can always change these settings in the future with the
“Plan Settings” option under the “Settings” menu.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/plan_settings.png"
alt="Fig 3. Screenshot of the plan settings window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 3. Screenshot of the plan settings
window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most of these options are intended to be self-explanatory. For more
details on editing your <strong>plan</strong>, see the <a
href="#Plans">plan section</a> of this document.</p>
<p>If you’re following the guide, after creating a <strong>plan</strong>
file, you’ll be prompted to also create a <strong>data</strong> file.
This file is a simple CSV file that tracks your weight over time. It is
kept separate from the plan file so that you can easily import it into
other programs or spreadsheet applications, or back it up
separately.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the <strong>data</strong> file always uses
kilograms as its weight unit, no matter what you set in your
<strong>plan</strong>. This is so that you can switch from one unit to
the other as often as you like, without rounding errors building up in
the file over time. It also means that the format of the
<strong>data</strong> file can be completely independent of its
associated plan.</p>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Once you have created your <strong>plan</strong> and
<strong>data</strong> files, you’re ready to begin using PyWeight!</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/main_window.png"
alt="Fig 4. Screenshot of the PyWeight main window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 4. Screenshot of the PyWeight main
window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s take a moment to get used to the PyWeight main window. The
window is separated into two panes. The first of these, on the left,
contains a table that you will use to enter your weight.</p>
<p>The PyWeight weight management concept revolves around weighing
yourself every day, so the interface is built around the assumption that
you will do this. PyWeight will continue to work if you occasionally
miss a day, but some other program would likely serve your needs better
if you plan to only record your weight on a weekly basis. For the
reasoning behind this behavior, see the <a
href="Technical%20Concepts.html">Technical Concepts</a> page or the
associated <a
href="https://adamfontenot.com/post/statistics-assisted_weight_loss_with_pyweight">blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>You use PyWeight by entering your weight regularly in the left pane.
Anything you enter will be automatically added to the graph in the right
pane. When you add or change a weight entry, you can save your changes
to the underlying data file by clicking “Save File” in the “File” menu,
or by pressing Ctrl-S. The program will also prompt you to save any
unsaved data when you quit. When a <strong>data</strong> file has been
edited, this is indicated by an asterisk <code>*</code> after the file
name in the program window title. An option to save changes to your data
files automatically is available in the PyWeight <a
href="#Settings">Settings</a>.</p>
<p>Normally, PyWeight will automatically create blank weight entries for
you. This happens whenever you add an entry, or when you restart the
program. In some cases — for example, if you leave the program open and
forget to record your weight for several days — you might want to
trigger the creation of new entries. You can do this with the “Refresh”
option under the “Data” menu item, or by pressing Ctrl-R.</p>
<p>When creating your <strong>plan</strong>, you set a frequency for the
program’s diet adjustment advice. After this many days have passed since
your first weight entry, PyWeight will give you advice that indicates
how closely you have adhered to your diet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/diet_advice.png"
alt="Fig 5. PyWeight’s diet advice" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 5. PyWeight’s diet
advice</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this example, the user has adhered quite closely to their intended
diet, and so PyWeight suggests a change of only 10 calories per day.
Such a value is small enough that no significant changes to one’s meal
plan would be called for. A larger difference, of 100 calories a day or
more, would suggest a tweak is needed.</p>
<p>Notice that the program has drawn a straight line through the data,
indicating what it estimates as the true weight of the user on each
date. Such an estimate is usually much more accurate than what the scale
said on that day (and you recorded), because it ignores the large swings
caused by changes in water weight and variations in meal size.</p>
<p>If the program has suggested you make a change, and you modify your
calorie intake, it wouldn’t make sense to continue the straight line
from the previous period of your diet. If you eat less than before, we
should expect your rate of weight loss to increase. Therefore PyWeight
will begin a new linear segment for the diet every time it suggests an
adjustment. Each new segment has an extra constraint: it is forced to be
continuous with each preceding segment. See the <a
href="Technical%20Concepts.html">Technical Concepts</a> page for more
about this.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to change the rate at which you are gaining or
losing weight (for example, if you achieve your goal weight and need to
begin maintaining), you can do so in your <a href="#Plans">plan
settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the options for weight management
plans.</p>
<p>To edit the settings for an existing <strong>plan</strong>, click
“Plan Settings” under the “Settings” menu. Settings you change in this
window will not be saved or applied to your plan until you click “Apply”
or “OK”.</p>
<h3 id="units">Units</h3>
<p>You can change your preferred units in PyWeight at any time. Changes
to units are lossless, meaning that they don’t cause rounding errors
during the conversion from one unit to another.</p>
<p>When you change the units option in the plan settings window, the
units displayed for other settings in the window will be converted
automatically for your convenience. Even though these values
automatically change, the changes are still not applied until you click
“OK” or “Apply”.</p>
<h3 id="desired-rate-of-weight-change">Desired Rate of Weight
Change</h3>
<p>You can enter the rate at which you want to change your weight in
this box. Notice that a negative value, such as the default of “-1
lbs/week”, indicates losing weight. A positive value would tell the
program that you want to gain weight. Of course, should you want to
maintain your current weight, you can simply enter 0 here.</p>
<p>The unmodified program will not allow you to enter clearly
unreasonable rates of weight change (no more than 3 pounds per week).
Note that just because the PyWeight allows you to enter a value, it is
not thereby endorsing your goal as reasonable for you or healthy for
anyone. It is up to you, in consultation with a doctor, to come up with
a reasonable target.</p>
<h3 id="diet-adjustment-frequency">Diet Adjustment Frequency</h3>
<p>Here you can select how often you want PyWeight to provide you with
advice on modifying your diet to hit your weight management target.
Values from 7 to 30 days are selectable; values from 14 to 21 days are
recommended. In general, the slower you are trying to lose weight, the
longer your dieting periods should be.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether or not to show the adjustment value every
day — as opposed to only on the diet adjustment day. The displayed
adjustment value is the advice that the program <em>would</em> provide,
if today was a scheduled adjustment day.</p>
<p>This option is provided because not being able to see how you are
doing could easily prove more annoying than helpful. However, as
indicated by the advice text, you should <em>not</em> use the adjustment
value to make changes to your meal plans except on the designated
adjustment day. This is because the program is built around the
assumption that your weight will change at a linear rate, making a
simple linear regression a reasonable approach for estimating your true
weight loss over time. See the <a
href="Technical%20Concepts.html">Technical Concepts</a> page for
more.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/diet_advice_2.png"
alt="Fig 6. Mid-period diet advice example" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 6. Mid-period diet advice
example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this example, the user is currently estimated to have eaten about
50 calories too much each day. However, they are instructed to continue
with their current meal plan (actual or estimated) for one more day,
until the end of the current adjustment period.</p>
<h3 id="initial-body-fat-percentage">Initial Body Fat Percentage</h3>
<p>This is the most complicated of the <strong>plan</strong> settings.
PyWeight uses the values provided to calculate the energy density of the
weight you lose (or gain) and from that the difference between the
number of calories you ate and the number needed to hit your goal.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/bfp.png"
alt="Fig 7. Body fat percentage settings" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 7. Body fat percentage
settings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If possible, you should select “Manual” mode and enter your true body
fat percentage. This value should be provided from an accurate medical
procedure such as a DEXA scan or body density measurement from
underwater weighing. At home measurements with electrostatic devices are
likely to be highly inaccurate and using the automatic mode is preferred
if this is all you have available.</p>
<p>The automatic mode will attempt to estimate your body fat percentage
at the start of your diet using your age, height, and gender. (Your
starting weight is also a factor, of course, but this is determined from
your entered data.) This is less accurate than manual mode, but still
much better than assuming the same value for everyone.</p>
<p>Age and height are self-explanatory. The gender option is a little
bit more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The authors of PyWeight reviewed the available medical literature on
estimation of body fat, and found it lacking in several respects. In
particular, many published formulae were not well-studied across
different races and no formula we could find looked at body fat in
transgender, non-binary, or intersex individuals.</p>
<p>Publishing the program with a strict binary as the only option is
unacceptable to the authors, and so we have made the following
compromise: users who wish may choose a “non-binary” option and select a
position on a range from female to male. The program will treat their
body as being a weighted average of female and male bodies. This should
not be understood as a reflection of the individual’s gender identity
but rather as simply a flawed approximation of how their body might
behave during weight changes.</p>
<p>The result is clearly suboptimal, but we believe we have made the
best compromise possible in view of the state of the literature. Users
who have additional recommendations or can point to relevant research
are welcomed to file an issue.</p>
<p>If no gender is selected, PyWeight will treat the user as an average
of the male and female options.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>PyWeight has several settings (independent of the settings for your
weight management plan) that can be adjusted. These settings are
available by clicking “PyWeight Settings” under the “Settings” menu.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/prefs.png"
alt="Fig 8. Screenshot of the PyWeight preferences window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 8. Screenshot of the PyWeight
preferences window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here you can choose whether your last used <strong>plan</strong> file
is reopened automatically.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether changes made to your data files (such as
adding a new weight entry) are automatically saved. You can always save
your changes using the File menu.</p>
<p>The PyWeight settings also contain an option to set the program
language. As of this writing, this function is inoperative, as no
translations have yet been provided for the program. If you are able to
translate PyWeight into another language, please create an issue.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-your-data">Exporting your data</h2>
<p>Because your data file is a simple CSV, you can copy and use it
directly in any other program that supports the same format, or easily
import the data into a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>You can export your weight tracking graph to other formats using the
Export option under the “Data” menu. Your graph can be saved as a PNG,
SVG, or PDF file. The file type will be determined automatically on the
basis of which extension you use.</p>
